                I started playing with computers when I was 10 years old. Since
                then I have been tinkering with all sorts of technologies that
                in some way or another led me to work on photo and video
                editing, design, and ultimately to web development.

                As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between
                engineering and design â€” combining my technical knowledge with
                my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product.

                When I&apos;m not in front of my coding screen, I&apos;m
                probably watching an anime, hanging out with my family, or
                carrying my team in the <b>Summoner&apos;s Rift</b> .
