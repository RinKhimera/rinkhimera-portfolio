          Hi, I&apos;m Samuel Pokam.
          <br /> I am a{" "}
          <span className="text-primary">full-stack developer,</span> with a
          particular interest in making things simple and automating daily
          tasks.

          <p>
            I started playing with computers when I was 10 years old. Since then
            I have been tinkering with all sorts of technologies that in some
            way or another led me to work on photo and video editing, design,
            and ultimately to web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a web developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and
            design â€” combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for
            design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build
            applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while
            providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.
          </p>

            <b>When I&apos;m not in front of my coding screen, </b>
            I&apos;m probably watching an anime, learning new stuff, or playing
            video games.
